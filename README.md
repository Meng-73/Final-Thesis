## Weekly Journal

####  Week 1: Identification of research themes and project directions

During the two meetings with my supervisor, we discussed the current hot issues in the society and finally decided on the research direction: to explore the impact of internet addiction on personal well-being by making a game. After defining the topic, we discussed in detail the objectives, scope and expected outcomes of the project. The week centred on clarifying the research questions and laying the groundwork for subsequent work.


#### Week 2: Research and gathering material

I began to delve into the literature and statistics related to internet addiction and happiness. By reading academic papers and related reports, I am accumulating a deep understanding of the topic. The goal of this week was to ensure that I had a deep understanding of the research topic to provide strong support for subsequent game design.


#### Week 3: Initial Game Design and Material Preparation

Created the project in Unity and started the game design. Created some basic 3D models, and for efficiency, I also downloaded some city models, character models and other resources such as buildings and cars from the Unity Asset Store. These resources provided the basis for my subsequent game scene building.

Importing the downloaded 3D models and created models into Scene One and adjusting their size and position to fit the game scene ensured that the individual models loaded and ran correctly in the game. The goal of this week was to lay a solid foundation for the visual presentation of the game through the preparation of the material.

#### Week 4: Character Movement and Control Scripting

Started writing control scripts for the characters in the game. By adding C# scripts to the game character, I was able to control the character's movement, including moving forward, backward, turning left, turning right, etc. I scripted the character and the camera so that I could control the character's movement and perspective using the WASD keys and mouse drag. The takeaway from this week was an initial grasp of the core techniques of character control in games.

#### Week 5: Character Interaction and Storyline Design

The game's storyline and character interactions became the focus of this week. I created engaging interactive elements in Unity, such as dying human characters, and scripted the player's interactions with these characters, including pop-up dialogues that show their voice when clicked and adding an " Quit" button in the dialogues to close the dialogues. At the same time, I created a thought-provoking storyline to ensure that the game resonated with the player and made them think. This week was all about adding colour to the game and making it not just entertaining, but a deep thought-provoking journey.

#### Week 6: Patrol Bots and Failure Mechanics Added

Patrol robots have been added to the game, and random walking of the robots in the scene has been implemented through scripts, injecting more elements into the game. At the same time, when the player is close to the robot, the game will trigger the failure mechanism to increase the fun of the game. After triggering the failure mechanism, a game over screen will be displayed. This week's work aims to increase the fun and challenge of the game and create a more engaging experience for the player.

#### Week 7: Game Failure Interface Design

Designed the Game Failure interface in Unity, which included displaying the "Game Over", Restart, and Quit buttons on the interface. By writing scripts, I made sure that these buttons worked the way they were supposed to and that the interface displayed as expected. When the "Restart" button is pressed, scenario one is reloaded, and when the "Quit" button is pressed, the game window is closed.

#### Week 8: Scene One Subtitles and Portal Design

Adding subtitle elements to Scene 1 adds layers to the narrative of the scene. By writing a script, I implemented a subtitle that triggers when the player approaches a portal, providing guidance to the player. At the same time, I designed and added the portal, adding a technological feel to it by adjusting the lighting effects. This week's work brought the game's narrative to life and provided the player with a deeper experience.

#### Week 9: Scene 1 and Scene 2 Transitions

Wrote scripts to enable switching between scenes so that a second scene can be loaded automatically after the player enters the portal, adding a sense of coherence to the game. Improved the visual smoothness of the scene switching by adding a black screen transition effect. The goal for this week was to make the player feel more natural and unobtrusive scene transitions in the game, and to improve the overall sense of immersion.

#### Week 10: Scenario Two Models and Character Scripts

Gameplay elements were enriched in the second scenario by introducing more models, including vehicles, buildings and characters. By writing scripts, the random walking of characters in the scenario was implemented, making the whole scenario more alive and lively. The aim of this week's work was to make the game's second scenario more detailed and to provide more opportunities for players to explore and discover.

#### Week 11: Scene 2 Subtitle Design

The subtitle element is introduced in the second scene, which is scripted to display subtitles at key moments, adding to the narrative experience of the game. The subtitle content is closely centred on the theme, guiding players to think about the subtle relationship between internet addiction and happiness, further enhancing the game's thoughtfulness and emotional resonance.

#### Week 12: Scene Sound Additions

Inject more sound elements into the game, including the sound of wind and heartbeat in Scene 1, and the city cacophony in Scene 2. By adjusting the volume and triggering conditions of the sound effects, we ensure that the sounds blend perfectly with the graphics and deepen players' emotional experience of the game's theme. The subtle use of sound effects further enhances the immersion and realism of the game.

#### Week 13: Game Optimisation and Trial

Optimise the game's performance, including graphics and smoothness. Export and share the game with friends for trial play and actively collect their feedback. My friends' suggestions mainly focused on the improvement of the game experience, especially the enhancement of sound effects. Based on the feedback, I decided to add more sound effects, such as game failure and portal sound effects, and successfully integrated new sound elements through script tweaks. I also added a game start screen to make the overall experience richer. This week's work was aimed at polishing the game and ensuring an even better experience for the player through careful optimisation and feedback fixes.
